              CHAPTER 1. Loomings.
              Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse,
              and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
              watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
              circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
              November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
              bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
              hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into
              the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea
              as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato
              throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If
              they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same
              feelings towards the ocean with me.
              <br />
              <br />
              There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral
              reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its
              extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes,
              which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
              <br />
              <br />
              Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and
              from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the
              town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the
              spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
              high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all
              landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
              desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?
              <br />
              <br />
              But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive.
              Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady
              lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly
              can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from
              lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell
              me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them
              thither?
              <br />
              <br />
              Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please,
              and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is
              magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on
              his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all
              that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your
              caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and
              water are wedded for ever.
              <br />
              <br />
              But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting
              bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There
              stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here
              sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep
              into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
              hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its
              sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed
              upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles
              you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of
              water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?
              Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate
              whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to
              Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some
              time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel
              such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why
              did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother
              of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of
              Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged
              into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the
              image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
