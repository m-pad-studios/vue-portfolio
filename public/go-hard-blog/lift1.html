        <p>
          Lifting heavy isn't just about the amount you can move. You see, lifting heavy is more a form of art than
          you'd think, it can cause immediate emotional reactions just as a painting or sculpture.
          When people see someone complete a ~500 kg (1102 lb) deadlift a natural reaction of just aw. <br /><br /> It
          takes
          years to master some of these lifts such as squats, deadlifts, or cleans. Most beginning artists aren't able
          to paint master pieces over night just as a beginner lifter more than likely wouldn't be able to correctly do
          a clean and jerk for the first time.<br /><br /> There is a shift that happens in lifting when you decide to
          go heavy.
          Form becomes the most important thing, without it you will more than likely injure yourself or fail the lift.
          <br /> <br />

          You know I can remember my first
          time squatting heavy, I was 145lbs at the time attempting a 225lb squat at Western Oregon University's
          gym.<br /><br /> Thing is to someone of
          my frame that's a big deal. Bar loaded, I take my position, my feet space themselves out into the perfect
          shoulder width and my hands somehow have a grip on the bar death couldn't even handle.
          My body was ready but my mind, mentally I had a block.

          <br />
        <section id="hero2" class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center" alt="Heavy Squat img"></section>
        <br />
        <p>
          With a swift slap to my ass my partner yells, "Form looks great, let's go. You got this!". I snap out of it
          and unrack while taking in a massive breath. Shacking all over I engage every muscle fiber, step back, and go
          ass to grass.
          <br /><br />
          To me the weight felt unbearable and when I hit the bottom my legs wanted to give out and explode. Everyone's
          eyes were on me at this point, and that's when my pride kicked in and my body found the strength. Face super
          red because I forgot to let my breath out on the way up, I successfully rack and hear cheering while I proceed
          to receive more slaps to my ass in victory.

          That was the last day of a 60 day training program doing a classic routine, The 5 X 5. I hit all my goals and
          more. I started out 135 lbs and ended 145 lbs with a ~135 lb overall average increase to my max weight per
          lift. My starting & ending stats I've posted below:

            <p>This is an example of a beginner lifters card set. Each week for each exercise you will increase the
              weight depending on the exercise by 5 or 10 lbs. It is most common for people with squats and deadlift to
              go up 10 lbs each week and barbell rows, landmine press, and bench by 5 lbs.<br /><br /> These lifts are
              specific and should be the ones to use as they are compound movements.
              Compound movements are core for every lifter to learn, master and have in their regiment of lifts.
              <br /><br /> You'll notice deadlift is the only lift with 1 set. It
              can be very challenging for a beginner lifter to squat and deadlift in the same day while each week
              increasing weight. <br /><br />The landmine press can be replaced with overhead press. Which the overhead
              press is
              usually the standard for this routine; however, if you're someone with a shoulder injury or diagnosed
              problem than I'd suggest the landmine press.
              The same muscles will be worked but the movement is safer on our rotator cuffs.</p>
            <br />

            <br />

            <p>
              So here is the break down for your weeks during this routine. Lifting 3 days a week, alternating workout
              cards A -> B -> A -> B,
              and with rest days in between and weekends off.<br /><br /> Trust me the rest is needed, especially when
              you start getting into the later weeks.
              When you lift heavy the body feels it and adapts to the stresses. That time the body is adapting it will demand the energy (calorie intake goes up) and rest to repair tissue. <br /><br /> Muscle and bone density
              occur due to the progressive weight increase each week
              so, feed the beast and get proper rest. When we work our muscle fibers out we create micro tears and only
              during rest do we actually increase the size of our muscle fibers.
