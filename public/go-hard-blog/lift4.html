                <p>
                    Stretching, a great topic to debate in the fitness world. I had teachers in college arguing almost
                    entire class periods on how
                    you should stretch or that you don't need to. One teacher flat out described stretching as worthless
                    and a waste of time, that same teacher was our athletic trainer too. Then I graduate and go to work
                    for several outpatient physical therapy clinics and almost every PT had their patients stretching.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Here's my experience and take on stretching: IT IS IMPORTANT!
                    <br />
                <section id="stretch1" class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center"
                    alt="Cat stretch img"></section>
                <p>
                    <br />
                    Not quite sure what my teacher was yammering about that one day but they were wrong. For example, if
                    you want to rehab a total knee replacement to get full range of motion back stretching is one of the
                    main treatments.
                    I never saw a patient not benefit from stretching but getting them to do the stretches, that was
                    whole other challenge. <br/><br/> See the thing I noticed the most with stretching is for the average person it
                    seems to be uncomfortable and boring, usually due to them never stretching before. I get it, it
                    isn't the most exciting activity but we are gonna go over some huge benefits on why it is needed.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    First let's take a quick glance at the various types of stretching. We gotta know what we are
                    dealing with here before we can become grand master stretchers:
                <p>
                <table class="table">
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <table class="table" id="workout-table">

                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Active</td>
                                <td>Passive</td>
                                <td>Dynamic</td>
                                <td>PNF</td>
                            </tr>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <br />
                    <p>Active Stretching: <br />
                        Putting the muscle through its ROM (Range of Motion) while holding for ~15 - 30 seconds. The
                        muscles performing the stretch are lengenthed and their opposing muscle groups are being
                        contracted.
                        If you've ever done a calf stretch against a wall and held it that'd be an active stretch. You're actively putting the muscle into motion.
                    </p>
                    <section id="stretch2" class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center"
                        alt="yoga mats img"></section>

                    <br />

                    <p> 
                        Passive Stretching: <br/>
                            Similar to active; however, a partner, machine assistance, or a specific stretching tool will progressively increase the range of motion and intensity of the stretch. When an athletic trainer helps do hamstring stretches, the athlete isn't putting the muscle through the motion, it is passively done by an external force.

                        <br/><br/> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dynamic Stretching:<br/>
                            Putting the muscle through a progressive increase to range of motion and stopping when you feel discomfort. When you see someone swinging their leg in an upward motion and gradually swinging the leg higher, that's a dynamic stretch. Each time the height is increased the intensity is as well.
                            <br/><br/>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation)
                    </p>
                    <div class="jumbotron-2">
                    </div>

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <section id="stretch4" class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center"
                        alt="yoga class img"></section>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                Now that the basic stretches are covered how are you supposed to go about doing them? Which ones are the best for us to consistently do? 
                <br/><br/>
                Not really a straight forward answer to those questions. Of course at the clinic we would treat based off diagnosis of patients injury or condition so everyone was different. <br/><br/> I mean we could treat a lower back and have the patient doing anyone of these stretches: child's pose or prayer, cat/cow, knee to chest or double knee to chest, piriformis, 90/90 hip lift, and then when they graduate (as we called it when you're done with therapy) they could be prescribed new stretches to keep doing to move forward with in life.
                <br/><br/>
                There isn't a set of "golden stretches" to always do, although if you want to keep all your joints flexible and maintain full range of motion throughout life it is highly suggested to stretch each major muscle group. In no way am I a licensed professional provider, I'm just giving feedback based off real life experience. When we would have someone come in with a TKR (total knee replacement) and they didn't do stretches at home their knee would lag behind in getting its ROM back. <br/><br/>
                Try getting into a car or walking up stairs when you can't bend your knee fully, it is more difficult than you'd think and can cause serious issues in the structure of your body. Take a look at this ROM chart from from <a target="_blank" href="https://peerwell.co/blog/range-of-motion-after-joint-replacement-surgery/" title="link to peerwell for reference">PeerWell</a> 
                <table class="table" id="workout-table">

                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>65° to walk</td>
                            <td>70° <br/>to lift an object from the floor</td>
                            <td>85° <br/>to climb stairs</td>
                            <td>95° <br/> to sit and stand comfortably</td>
                            <td>105° to tie shoelaces</td>
                            <td>115° (or greater) to squat or sit cross-legged<br/></tr>
                        </tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>
                    Let's expand on the knee example and move to the hip.   Someone that walks with their hips out of alignment could have any of these: be in a lot of pain, can't run, balance is thrown off, and structurally our hip bones should be aligned and with this condition one side is usually higher than the other restricting the hips full ROM. Stretching of the raised hip joint I've seen be used plenty of times to help bring the hip joint back to neutral alignment.

      There is a plethora of information out there on stretching and the positive impact it has on our bodies. Here are a few sources you can check out that are excellent free tools. <br/><br/>

      <a href="https://www.hep2go.com/" target="_blank" title="link to hep2go">HEP2GO</a> - Each exercise you look up there is a detailed description on how to properly do the movement. You can create custom workouts and email them to yourself, personal care provider, or trainer. We used it a lot in the clinics with good responses overall from patients and providers.

There are a few exercises that are strengthening but there are a lot of good stretches on there and the information overall is solid.
